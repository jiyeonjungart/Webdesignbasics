		<div class="context">
            The challenge I'd like to tackle is to create a website that will allow me to organize and present my work to 
            the general public, including potential employers and other artists. I'd also like the website to highlight my 
            good organization, typography, and overall simple and minimalistic aesthetic.

     <h2 class="context-titles">2. Discovery and Research</h2>
		<div class="context">
            I researched the number of online portfolios that was established by various artist. I have discovered that they developed 
            website aesthetics that corresponded to their art style in order to offer a consistent theme throughout their portfolio and 
            to represent themselves in a particular manner. Some of them even incorporated interactive entertaining aspects to their websites in order 
            to make them stand out and demonstrate their capabilities in UX design.
