		<h2 class="context-titles">Intent</h2>

			To provide professional information about an individual and showcase their past work and experience to potential clients or companies.

			The website is divided into a few sections: The home page, archived work sample, and past work examples. 
			The home page contains the picture of Tais Kahatt, an introduction of herself, simple introductions of past works,
			her design philosophy, a box that leads to an archived work sample page, a brief description of her professional experience,
			award history, and contact information. The home page is direct and not text-heavy, and the images are well displayed to keep
			the minimalistic tone of the page.
			<br>
			<br>
			The archived work page is mostly photos that can be viewed with a few clicks, a brief description of her professional experience,
			award history, and contact information. Unlike the homepage, the archived work page centers around the visual element.
			<br>
			<br>
			When the past work example list on the homepage is clicked, it leads to the past work example pages. Past work pages include the 
			title of the project, information about the client and the project, photos of the final products, and a list of other examples that
			 leads to another example page. The page had a good balance of text and images.
			<br>
			<br>
			The overall tone of the website was relatively consistent, giving the minimalistic aesthetic with hints of personality. 
		</p>

		<h2 class="context-titles">Brand</h2>
		<p class="context">
			The website represents its brand very well as it straightforwardly communicates to the audience, and the aesthetic of the website
			well suited her work.

      Mark is a 28 years old Brooklyn coffee shop owner, and he lives in the same building as his coffee shop. He is a morning person who wakes up at
      5 AM to meditate. He has an outgoing personality that attacks people in his coffee shop. Music is one of his biggest passions other than growing his business
      , so he makes music as a side job. Mark is all about organic and healthy lifestyles and has a huge interest in sustainability.
			<br>
			<br>
			As Brooklyn is one of the "hip" areas of New York, Mark is very interested in trendy aesthetics since he needs his coffee shop to keep in business.
      In other words, he needs to keep his brand trendy and get social media's attention. To do that, Mark needs a product designer who can design
      his products, such as coffee cups, brand logo, coffee bean bags, and so on. This makes him a potential client for Tais.
			<br>
			<br>
      Mark is particularly attracted to Tais' website as he notices the website's voice has a trendy aesthetic. The website also informs Mark 
      about Tais's past work and award history, showing that she is a trustworthy product designer. The minimalistic but artsy voice is what Mark needs for
      his business since that is what sells his coffee because he needs his products to be "grammable." Tais' website also shows her archived work, which attracts
      Mark to look into it to see if anything would particularly suit his needs.

			<br>
			<br>
			Jamie is attracted to Tais' website as she finds an example of other product designers' portfolio websites. As Tais seems like a successful freelance product designer, Jamie
      tries to inspect the website to get some inspiration for her portfolio website. As Jamie wants to stand out, she plans to build a website that is straightforward and represents 
			her design philosophy and aesthetic. Tais' website is an excellent example of what Jamie potentially wants her website to look like.

			Claire is a 19 years old sophomore majoring in communication design at Pratt University. She lives in Long Island City and commutes to school. She is a goal-oriented and organized person.
			She wants to start building her portfolio website to have something to submit for her future internships and jobs. She is into a minimalistic and trendy aesthetic and is looking
			for examples to refer to.
			<br>
			<br>
			Tais' website is one of the examples that Claire is looking for as it is an aesthetic that she like, and it seems like a well-organized website that can be appealing to the hiring managers. She
			like that the website is simple and not overloaded with too many elements that will make the website too messy. She also likes the little details in the website that makes the website interesting to look at.
			She is particularly impressed by the website's dark mode and notes how the text glides onto the screen as she scrolls the pages.

		<h2 class="context-titles">Competition</h2>
		<p class="context">
			In order to compete with its competitor, I believe that this website needs a little bit more of a personal touch that can differentiate.
			Although the website itself is well informed and well communicated, it seems like it needs to have something more to grab potential clients' attention. 
			For example, having a piece of personal information that might seem relatable to the audience could be one way to attract clients. 
			The website itself is a good starting point for inspiration and reference.
