    Toxic Substances in Our Clothes
</div>

<div class="content">
    Chemicals are used in every part of the textile production for making fibers, bleaching and dyeing fabrics, etc… When they arrive in the shops, our clothes still contain a lot of chemicals, even clothes made of "100% natural" fiber. Our skin is our body's largest organ and absorbs anything we put on it, including chemicals in our clothes. These can present a real danger to our health.    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    A Greenpeace study for the Detox Campaign has identified 11 chemicals frequently used to make our clothes that contain toxins, carcinogens, and hormone disruptors which should be banned, but currently aren't.    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Some Studies show that certain chemical substances contained in pajamas, can be found in a child's urine 5 days after wearing those pajamas for one night.
    <br>
    <br>
    A recent study found hazardous chemicals in 63% of the items tested from 20 different textile brands (including fashion giants).
