		<p class="context">
			For this project, I will be recreating an existing business website in order to practice developing a professional website myself. I will be recreating it as a website as much as possible in my current skill set. Although I would not be able to duplicate it the same because the professional website would be using different programs other than HTML and CSS, I believe that this exercise will help me to understand and learn how the professional website is structured and operate.

		<p class="context">
			I decided to recreate the <a href="https://www.glossier.com/">Glossier.com</a>. Glossier is a beauty brand that was founded in 2014. They focus on creating products that can demonstrate a clean, light-weight, and no-makeup makeup look. They are currently selling skincare, makeup, body care, and fragrance. Reflecting on the goal for the brand, the website has a clean, minimalistic, and girly look to it. They have light pink, black, and white as their primary color scheme. The website focuses on giving an easy and clean user experience as it mainly makes its profit through online stores.
